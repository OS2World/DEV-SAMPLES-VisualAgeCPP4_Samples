<h3>2DCombo Graphics Sample</h3>
<b>

<p>Description</b> </p>

<p>2DCombo contains canned tests of most of primitive geometry and MGraphics objects as
well as attributes, matrices and the rendering pipeline. </p>

<p><b>Concept</b> </p>

<p>2DCombo demonstrates programming using the 2D Graphics classes. It shows how to create
and draw objects such as curves, rectangles, and loops, and how to use attibutes, matrics
and the rendering pipeline. </p>

<p><b>Task</b> </p>

<p>Select the type of graphic you want to display from the menu. </p>

<p><b>Special Notes</b> </p>

<p>On Windows 95, there are some differences from Windows NT.&nbsp; In particular, text
and images do not support rotation or perform other transforms. Also, text does not scale
but images will, to some extent. All operations work correctly on NT. </p>
