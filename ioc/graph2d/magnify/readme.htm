<h3>Magnify Sample</h3>

<p><b>Description</b> </p>

<p>The Magnify Sample illustrates creating IImage objects given a desktop rectangle. You
specify the rectangle centered around the current mouse pointer. Every time a timer
expires, the rectangle around the mouse pointer is passed to the IGImage::captureImage
function. The IGImage returned from this call is used to construct the IImage object
containing the screen image around the mouse pointer. This image is then displayed in the
client area. When the client area of the sample application is larger than the capturing
rectangle, it has the affect of magnifying the desktop image. You can also save the image
to a file in bitmap, GIF, JPEG, or XPM format. </p>

<p><b>Concept</b> </p>

<p>Sample program for demonstrating IImage, IGImage, IGrafport, IBitmapControl,
INumericSpinButton, IFileDialog, and ITimer. </p>

<p><b>Task</b> </p>

<p>Select the Start button to have the area around the mouse pointer magnified within
the window.  Use the spin buttons to vary the size of the magnification area.</p>
