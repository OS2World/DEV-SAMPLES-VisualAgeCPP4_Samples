<h3>DDE Client/Server Sample</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The DDE Sample contains two applications. They are the DDE Client and DDE Server. Each
is located in a subdirectory. These two applications start DDE conversations with each
other and can perform data requests to the other application. In addition they can be
hotlinked together for automatic data requests. Classes used include
IDDEClientConversation, IDDEClientAcknowledge, IDDEClientEndEvent, IDDEClientHotLinkEvent,
IDDEClientHotLinkSet, IDDEBeginEvent, IDDEEndEvent, IDDETopicServer, IDDERequestDataEvent,
IDDEServerHotLinkEvent, and IDDEAcknowledgeEvent. DDE is not supported on Unix platforms. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Demonstrates interprocess communications using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>By starting a conversation between the client and server, you can request information
and actions to the server. Hotlinks communicate between the client and server continually.
</p>

<p><strong>How To Run the Project from within the IDE</strong></p>

<p>The DDE Client and Server applications work together. Open the DDE\DDEServ project. Run
the DDE Server application. Open the DDE\DDEClnt project. Run the DDE Client application. </p>
