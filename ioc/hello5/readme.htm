<h3>Hello World Sample 5</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Version 5 greatly increases the functionality of the sample by adding a listbox and
graphics window to the client area of the main frame window. The listbox is used to
display a &quot;Hello World&quot; in different languages. A select handler is used to
update the static text with whatever &quot;Hello World&quot; string is selected from the
listbox. The graphics window uses the Open Class graphics to display a view of the earth
from space. The client area is layed-out using ISplitCanvas objects to allow the user to
specify proportions for the sections.</p>

<p>Hello5 also introduces the use of the IHelpWindow class for providing context-specific
application help. The use of IPF formatted information source files, RTF formatted
information source files, and resource file help tables is also demonstrated. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Sample program with frame window, menu bar from resource, information area, accelerator
resources, dialog window, listbox, graphics, split-canvas, and help. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>Select from the menu bar tasks to justify the client area text on the left, center, or
right. The information area displays menu item messages. You can change the client area
text through the text dialog frame window. You can also change the client area text
through the listbox selections. The world is drawn using graphics. </p>

<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>

<p>The sample attempts to load its help from its current working directory.</p>
