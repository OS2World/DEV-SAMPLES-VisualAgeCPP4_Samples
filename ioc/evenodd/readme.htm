<h3>Even/Odd Sample</h3>
<b>

<p>Description</b> </p>

<p>This program creates sets using the default class, ISet. The &quot;odd&quot; set
contains all odd numbers less than ten. The &quot;prime&quot; set contains all prime
numbers less than ten. The program creates a set, &quot;oddPrime&quot; that contains all
the prime numbers less than ten that are odd, by using the intersection of &quot;odd&quot;
and &quot;prime&quot;. It creates another set, &quot;evenPrime&quot;, that contains all
the prime numbers less than ten that are even, by using the difference of
&quot;prime&quot; and &quot;oddPrime&quot;. </p>

<p><b>Concept</b> </p>

<p>This program is a sample to demonstrate the use of the default class ISet. </p>

<p><b>Task</b> </p>

<p>This program uses sets to store odd and prime numbers. </p>
