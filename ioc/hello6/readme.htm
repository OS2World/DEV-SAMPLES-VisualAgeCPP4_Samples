<h3>Hello World Sample 6</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>While this final version of the Hello World samples is much more complex than hello1,
it contains a large amount of common application functionality and demonstrates many of
the interactions and class usage required by a real user interface application.</p>

<p>Hello6 adds all of the following: real time date and time fields on the main window;
use of a font dialog; a new settings frame containing an INotebook object with two pages
of canvases and controls; use of IProfile class for storing the settings; and pop-up menus
for making the stars twinkle. Hello6 also replaces the entry field in the dialog window
with a drop-down list combination box. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Sample program with frame window, menu bar from resource, information area, accelerator
resources, dialog window, listbox, graphics, split-canvas, help, notebook, profile, and
timer. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>Select from the menu bar tasks to justify the client area text on the left, center, or
right. The information area displays menu item messages. You can change the client area
text through the text dialog frame window. You can also change the client area text
through the listbox selections. In addition, you can change the font for the client area
text. The world is drawn using graphics. You can change the graphics from the settings
notebook. </p>

<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>

<p>The sample attempts to load its help from its current working directory.</p>
