Planets Sample</H3>
<B>Description</B>

<P>This program uses the default class, ISortedSet, to create sorted lists
of planets with different properties. The program stores all planets in
our solar system, and all heavy or bright planets in our solar system in
a number of sorted sets. Each set sorts the planets by its distance from
the sun.

<P><B>Concept</B>

<P>This program is a sample to demonstrate the use of the default classes
ISortedSet and how to use the elements' properties as a sorting criterion.

<P><B>Task</B>

<P>This program uses sorted sets to store planets with different properties.
