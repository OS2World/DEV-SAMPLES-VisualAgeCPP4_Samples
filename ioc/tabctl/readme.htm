<h3>Tab Control Sample</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The Tab Control sample demonstrates the use of the ITabControl and ITabPage classes.
The ITabControl has features for managing push buttons and context help.
Three ITabPages are created.  Each page exploits delayed page window creation when
the page is selected for view.
The first page contains user controls and common buttons defined in the library.
You cannot turn to another page until the criteria in validatePageWindow() is met.
The second page contains user controls, two user buttons, and one button defined
in the library.
The third page contains a photograph and common buttons defined in the library.</p>
<p>This sample demonstrates builtin help for each ITabPage.
The use of IPF formatted information source files, RTF formatted
information source files, and resource file help tables is also demonstrated. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Sample program demonstrates a tab control, tab page, static text, entry fields,
push buttons, radio buttons, view ports, bitmaps, and help.
The controls on the Statistics page are not editable.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>Fill in the first and last name of the sponsor.  Select a cheetah from the list.
Now, you can click the Statistics and Photo tab pages. </p>


<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>

<p>The sample attempts to load its help from its current working directory.</p>
