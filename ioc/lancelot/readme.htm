<h3>Lancelot: A Valiant Example</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Lancelot is a complex sample intended to represent a typical customer application.
Lancelot is a tool for tracking employees, employee time cards, and business projects. The
main window is the launching point for employee queries. Actions appear on the menu bar,
toolbar, and container object popup menus. After filling in query criteria in the Query
Personnel notebook, a container with employees matching your search criteria appears.
Actions also appear on the menu bar, toolbar, and employee object popup menus. Specific
employee information appears when opening the employee. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Lancelot uses many User Interface classes. Just a few of these include IFrameWindow,
IMenuBar, Infoarea, IHelp, IFont, IResourceLibrary, IContainerControl, IContainerObject,
IPopupMenu, INotebook, IMultiCellCanvas, ISetCanvas, IProfile, IEntryField, IPushButton,
IGraphicPushButton, INumericSpinButton, IComboBox, ICheckBox, IMenuBar, ITitle, IString,
ICommandHandler, ICnrHandler, ICnrMenuHandler, IToolBar, IToolBarButton, IFlyOverHelp,
IFlyOverHelpHandler, Direct Manipulation (i.e. Drag/Drop), and graphics. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

<p>Open the Query Personnel notebook. Initially, the database has no employees. Pressing
the query (magnifying glass) button, you are asked if you wish to create an employee.
Another notebook appears. Fill in the information for the employee and close the notebook.
Now you are ready to query employees. To show all employees, place an asterick (*) in the
Employee ID field and press the query button. </p>

<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>

<p>The sample attempts to load its help from its current working directory.</p>
